Unofficial pytorch implementation of paper: Neural Network Inversion in Adversarial Setting via Background Knowledge Alignment

## Description
This this an <b>unofficial</b> pytorch implementation of paper:	Z. Yang, J. Zhang, E.-C. Chang, and Z. Liang, "Neural Network Inversion in Adversarial Setting via Background Knowledge Alignment."


The official code from the author can be found at:https://github.com/yziqi/adversarial-model-inversion

## Usage
The main branch contains the code for attacking the MNIST dataset. 

* main.py -- train the target network
* test.py -- test the target network
* attack.py -- perform model inversion attack
* turn_to_list.py -- code to make the dataset index
* the four txts -- dataset index files

<b>IMPORTANT: The code runs successfully on my machine. However, I might forgot to describe some details when writting this readme. So feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:zhangzp9970@outlook.com) or GitHub issues :)</b>

## Third-party libraries

* pytorch 1.8.1
* torchvision
* [easydl](https://github.com/thuml/easydl)
* tqdm
* numpy
* some standard python libs
* [mnist_png](https://github.com/myleott/mnist_png)

## Differents
I only test my code on the 'Generic' settings. I use 0,1,2,3,4 to train the classifier and 5,6,7,8,9 to train the inversion network.

Instead of the official MNIST dataset, I use [this project](https://github.com/myleott/mnist_png) to extract the image datas from MNIST databyte file into png images.
